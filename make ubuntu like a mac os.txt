For making our ubuntu os like a mac os, so we will follow some steps:

1) we will extract our "McOS-CTLina-Gnome-1.3.2.tar.xz" & "Mc-OS-CTLina-Gnome-Dark-1.3.2.tar.xz" files and copy this two folder and paste it under the
computer/usr/share/themes folder
resource (https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1241688/)(download above two items)

2) then we will extract our "Cupertino-Catalina.tar.xz" file and copy this folder and paste it under the
computer/usr/share/icons folder
resource (https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1102582/)(download above one item)

3) then we will extract our "mcOS11-Shell.zip" & "mcOS11-Shell-Dark.zip" files and go to filemanager>home>switch on "show hidden files" and create
".themes" folder and copy this two folders and paste here in the ".themes"
folder.
resource (https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1220826/)(download above two items)

4) here we will reload our ".themes" folder

5) now we will go to tweak tool>"Appearance" and select:
applications: Mc-OS-CTina-Gnome-Dark-1.3.2
icons: Cupertino-Catalina
shell: McOS-CTLina-Gnome-1.3.2/McOS-CTLina-Gnome-Dark-1.3.2

6) open tweak tool and go to "Extensions" and check the button:
Desktop icons(here click settings and we can uncheck 2nd & 3rd option),
ubuntu dock,
user themes.

7) open tweak tool and go to "Window Titlebars" and select placement "left".

============== It's look like boom. =============

[ Important Note: if we can't copy or paste any folder or file to any other folder,so we will open our terminal and give a command: 
sudo chmod a+rwx /path/to/file ]
